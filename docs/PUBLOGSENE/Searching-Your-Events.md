By connecting to port **80** on **logsene-receiver.sematext.com** (or
443, if you want HTTPS), you can use the Elasticsearch API to search
through your data, in the same way [you can send
it](Sending-Events-to-Logsene_19726360.html).

Logsene comes with its own UI, which integrates nicely with other
Sematext apps, such as [SPM](http://sematext.com/spm/) (seeÂ [pub-SPM
Wiki](https://sematext.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUBSPM)). You can also
use [Kibana](Kibana_19726376.html). Or deploy your own UI or custom
scripts.

Besides web UI, there's also [Logsene
CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/logsene-cli), a command line
interface for searching through logs, with the ability to pipe the
output to `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort` and other useful shell commands.
See [Logsene CLI
Introduction](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/07/07/logsene-cli/).

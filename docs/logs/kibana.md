desrciption: Sematext's Logsene is the first true hosted ELK Stack as a serivce with Elasticsearch API and integrated Kibana

Kibana is analytics and visualization platform used to perform various searches and create logging analytics dashboards.

Kibana is fully intergrated with Sematext's analytics and visualization platform used to monitor, search, analyze, and visualize your data interactively, and customize dashboards that you can then use to analyze log data and perform advanced management tasks.

To visualize your data using [Kibana integrated into Logs Management App](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/06/11/1-click-elk-stack-hosted-kibana-4/),
you have to click on the **Kibana** button in the App Settings dropdown next to the application's
name, from the [Logs section](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs) in our infrastructure & application monitoring and log management platform.

Once you're there, you can customize your dashboard to do all kinds of
searches and visualizations to your data.

If you want even more flexibility, you can [install Kibana locally and point it to our Logs Management App](faq/#can-i-run-kibana-locally-and-point-it-to-logsene).

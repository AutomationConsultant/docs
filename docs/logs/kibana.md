To visualize your data using [Kibana integrated into Logs Management App](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/06/11/1-click-elk-stack-hosted-kibana-4/),
you have to click on the **Kibana** button next to the application's

Once you're there, you can customize your dashboard to do all kinds of
searches and visualizations to your data.

If you want even more flexibility, you can [install Kibana locally and point it to our Logs Management App](faq/#can-i-run-kibana-locally-and-point-it-to-logsene).

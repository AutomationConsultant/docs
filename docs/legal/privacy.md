**Web Services Users and Web Site Visitors**

Like most Web services operators, Sematext collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Sematext’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Sematext’s visitors use its website and services. From time to time, Sematext may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website and services.

Sematext also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Sematext does not use such information to identify its visitors and does not disclose such information other than under the circumstances described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to Sematext’s websites and services choose to interact with Sematext in ways that require Sematext to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Sematext gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users of the Sematext application to provide a username and email address. In each case, Sematext collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Sematext. Sematext does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.

**Aggregated Statistics**

Sematext may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and service. For instance, Sematext may reveal aggregate data on how much data an average customer collects, or what the most common type of data are across all customers. However, Sematext does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Metric & Event Data**

Sematext collects, processes, aggregates, and stores metrics and event data for its customers. Sematext in turn will not disclose individual metric or event data other than aggregates as described above or for the purposes described below.

**Protection of certain personally-identifying information**

Sematext discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Sematext’s behalf or to provide services available at Sematext’s service, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Sematext’s services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Sematext will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Sematext discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Sematext believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Sematext, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Sematext service and have supplied your email address, Sematext may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Sematext and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Sematext takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

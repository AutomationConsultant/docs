Metric Name                            |  Key                                        |  Metric Type  |  Numeric Type  |  Unit      |  Description
---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
binlog cache disk use                  |  mysql.binlog.cache.use.disk                |  counter      |  long          |            |  Binlog_cache_disk_use: The number of transactions that used the temporary binary log cache but that exceeded the value of binlog_cache_size and used a temporary file to store statements from the transaction
binlog cache use                       |  mysql.binlog.cache.use                     |  counter      |  long          |            |  Binlog_cache_use: The number of transactions that used the temporary binary log cache
binlog stmt cache disk use             |  mysql.binlog.stmt.cache.use.disk           |  counter      |  long          |            |  Binlog_stmt_cache_disk_use: The number of nontransaction statements that used the binary log statement cache but that exceeded the value of binlog_stmt_cache_size and used a temporary file to store those statements
binlog stmt cache use                  |  mysql.binlog.stmt.cache.use                |  counter      |  long          |            |  Binlog_stmt_cache_use: The number of nontransactional statements that used the binary log statement cache
binlog cache size                      |  mysql.binlog.cache.size                    |  gauge        |  long          |  bytes     |  binlog_cache_size: The size of the cache to hold the SQL statements for the binary log during a transaction. A binary log cache is allocated for each client if the server supports any transactional storage engines and if the server has the binary log enabled (--log-bin option). If you often use large, multiple-statement transactions, you can increase this cache size to get better performance
binlog stmt cache size                 |  mysql.binlog.stmt.cache.size               |  gauge        |  long          |            |  binlog_stmt_cache_size: Beginning with MySQL 5.5.9, this variable determines the size of the cache for the binary log to hold nontransactional statements issued during a transaction. In MySQL 5.5.3 and later, separate binary log transaction and statement caches are allocated for each client if the server supports any transactional storage engines and if the server has the binary log enabled (--log-bin option). If you often use large nontransactional statements during transactions, you can increase this cache size to get more performance
binlog max size                        |  mysql.binlog.size.max                      |  gauge        |  long          |  bytes     |  max_binlog_size: If a write to the binary log causes the current log file size to exceed the value of this variable, the server rotates the binary logs (closes the current file and opens the next one). The minimum value is 4096 bytes. The maximum and default value is 1GB.
seconds behind master                  |  mysql.repl.slave.behind.seconds            |  gauge        |  long          |  sec       |  Seconds_Behind_Master: This field is an indication of how “late” the slave is. In essence, this field measures the time difference in seconds between the slave SQL thread and the slave I/O thread. If the network connection between master and slave is fast, the slave I/O thread is very close to the master, so this field is a good approximation of how late the slave SQL thread is compared to the master. If the network is slow, this is not a good approximation
slave received heartbeats              |  mysql.repl.slave.heartbeats.received       |  counter      |  long          |            |  Slave_received_heartbeats: This counter increments with each replication heartbeat received by a replication slave since the last time that the slave was restarted or reset, or a CHANGE MASTER TO statement was issued
slave heartbeat period                 |  mysql.repl.slave.heartbeats.period         |  gauge        |  double        |  sec       |  Slave_heartbeat_period: Shows the replication heartbeat interval on a replication slave

If the value is greater than zero, it is not safe to shut down the slave
slave retried transactions             |  mysql.repl.slave.transactions.retired      |  counter      |  long          |            |  Slave_retried_transactions: The total number of times since startup that the replication slave SQL thread has retried transactions
handler read first                     |  mysql.handler.read.first                   |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_first: The number of times the first entry in an index was read. If this value is high, it suggests that the server is doing a lot of full index scans; for example, SELECT col1 FROM foo, assuming that col1 is indexed
handler read key                       |  mysql.handler.read.key                     |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_key: The number of requests to read a row based on a key. If this value is high, it is a good indication that your tables are properly indexed for your queries
handler read last                      |  mysql.handler.read.last                    |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_last: The number of requests to read the last key in an index. With ORDER BY, the server will issue a first-key request followed by several next-key requests, whereas with With ORDER BY DESC, the server will issue a last-key request followed by several previous-key requests. This variable was added in MySQL 5.6.1
handler read next                      |  mysql.handler.read.next                    |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_next: The number of requests to read the next row in key order. This value is incremented if you are querying an index column with a range constraint or if you are doing an index scan
handler read prev                      |  mysql.handler.read.prev                    |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_prev: The number of requests to read the previous row in key order. This read method is mainly used to optimize ORDER BY ... DESC
handler read rnd                       |  mysql.handler.read.rnd                     |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_rnd: The number of requests to read a row based on a fixed position. This value is high if you are doing a lot of queries that require sorting of the result. You probably have a lot of queries that require MySQL to scan entire tables or you have joins that do not use keys properly
handler read rnd next                  |  mysql.handler.read.rnd.next                |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_read_rnd_next: The number of requests to read the next row in the data file. This value is high if you are doing a lot of table scans. Generally this suggests that your tables are not properly indexed or that your queries are not written to take advantage of the indexes you have
handler commit                         |  mysql.handler.commit                       |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_commit: The number of internal COMMIT statements
handler delete                         |  mysql.handler.delete                       |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_delete: The number of times that rows have been deleted from tables
handler discover                       |  mysql.handler.discover                     |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_discover: The MySQL server can ask the NDBCLUSTER storage engine if it knows about a table with a given name. This is called discovery. Handler_discover indicates the number of times that tables have been discovered using this mechanism
handler prepare                        |  mysql.handler.prepare                      |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_prepare: A counter for the prepare phase of two-phase commit operations
handler rollback                       |  mysql.handler.rollback                     |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_rollback: The number of requests for a storage engine to perform a rollback operation
handler savepoint                      |  mysql.handler.savepoint                    |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_savepoint: The number of requests for a storage engine to place a savepoint

handler update                         |  mysql.handler.update                       |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_update: The number of requests to update a row in a table
handler write                          |  mysql.handler.write                        |  counter      |  long          |            |  Handler_write: The number of requests to insert a row in a table
queries in cache                       |  mysql.cache.queries.cached                 |  gauge        |  long          |            |  Qcache_queries_in_cache: The number of queries registered in the query cache
queries not cached                     |  mysql.cache.queries.noncached              |  counter      |  long          |            |  Qcache_not_cached: The number of noncached queries (not cacheable, or not cached due to the query_cache_type setting)
lowmem prunes                          |  mysql.cache.queries.prunes.lowmem          |  counter      |  long          |            |  Qcache_lowmem_prunes: The number of queries that were deleted from the query cache because of low memory
hits                                   |  mysql.cache.queries.hits                   |  counter      |  long          |            |  Qcache_hits: The number of query cache hits
inserts                                |  mysql.cache.queries.inserts                |  counter      |  long          |            |  Qcache_inserts: The number of queries added to the query cache

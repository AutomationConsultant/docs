*How Sematext works*

Supported integrations let you collect metrics, logs and events across your whole stack. Our solution goes beyond collecting metrics and detects anomalies, uncovers your slowest transactions, communication between servers and applications, etc.Sematext includes a fully integrated Kibana and exposes the Elasticsearch API. It works with all standard logging facilities and agents (such as syslog, Logstash, Fluentd, Flume, nxlog, Filebeat, etc) and integrates in minutes.


*Not sure where to look?*

Since Sematext Cloud is an all-in-one Monitoring and Logging solution, our documentation is split into Log Management and Performance Monitoring, plus a separate section dedicated to Sematext Enterprise which is Sematext Cloud for deployment on customer’s own infrastructure.

*If you have questions, we’re here to help.*
